		<h2>Pilau description</h2>
		<p>
			Pilau has a wonderful balance of flavors. It is a festive dish, which is
			never missing during special occasions or events. It’s made with rice
			cooked in a well-seasoned broth of Meat or chicken. Unlike the Indian
			pilau, the East African version does not use curry and it’s less spicy.
		</p>
		<p>
			Rice is, without a doubt, one of my favorite food in the world. Not only
			is it my to-go dish when I need to prepare a quick meal, but it can easily
			be turned into an elegant dish for special occasions.

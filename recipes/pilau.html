		<h2>Pilau description</h2>
		<p>
			Pilau has a <strong>wonderful balance of flavors</strong>. It is a festive
			dish, which is never missing during special occasions or events. It’s made
			with rice cooked in a well-seasoned broth of Meat or chicken. Unlike the
			Indian pilau, the East African version does not use curry and it’s less
			spicy.
		</p>
		<p>
			<strong>Rice</strong> is, without a doubt, one of my favorite food in the
			world. Not only is it my to-go dish when I need to prepare a quick meal,
			but it can easily be turned into an elegant dish for special occasions.
